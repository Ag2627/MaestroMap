# 🧭 Problem It Solves

## 🌍 The Real-World Problem

Planning a trip is one of the most **exciting yet exhausting** parts of traveling.  
People often spend **hours jumping between websites**, travel blogs, maps, and review platforms trying to answer questions like:
- Which places are worth visiting?
- What are the nearby attractions, hotels, and restaurants?
- Are the reviews genuine and updated?
- How can I plan everything without missing hidden gems?

This scattered information makes **trip planning complicated, time-consuming, and inefficient** — especially for those who want quick, smart, and personalized recommendations.

## 💡 The Need for an Intelligent Travel Assistant

Travelers today expect **personalized, AI-driven suggestions** that go beyond static lists or reviews.  
However, most travel platforms still rely on **manual search and filtering**, which:
- Doesn’t understand **user preferences** (budget, mood, interests, etc.)
- Lacks **real-time adaptability** (like events or weather changes)
- Provides **generic suggestions**, not context-aware plans

Hence, there is a strong need for a **smart assistant** that can combine:
- **AI (for personalization and trip logic)**  
- **Google Places API (for real-time verified data)**  
- **Automation (for instant trip creation)**
